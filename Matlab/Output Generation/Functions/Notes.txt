1) RN_3D_Paraview : This function calculates line end point of each element to be written in Paraview. It also calculates following 
physical quantities for each element: strain, curvature, strain energy and its components (bending, membrane and torsion).
Calls Patch_Energy function, which calculates above physical quantities for a patch of elements.

2) RN_3D_Plot_Deformed : Plots deformed network in matlab

3) Write_VTK_Network_Line : This function actually creates the vtk file and writes coordinates of lines and physical quantities associated
with them
